## Channel-Coding-Utility

This utility can help you decide which error correction algorithm you want to implement for your communication system.


## Getting started

If you just want to use the program, run the executable (which will be added some time in the future).
Your antivirus software might complain, but you can run it without installing anything else.

If you want to run the scripts in Python, install the necessary packages
(I believe it's obvious that you need to have Python installed).
Just copy this into your CMD-Window:
```commandline
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install FreeSimpleGUI
```

open main.py to run the script as intended.
