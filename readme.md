## Channel-Coding-Utility

This utility can help you decide which error correction algorithm you want to implement for your communication system.

I am developing this project for myself, not to make a professional software.

You can post suggestions, questions and critique, but I wont respond to anything regarding my coding style.
Really don't care weather it's PEP-conform or not.

If you'd like to contribute, don't spread your code in too many files or make it overly complicated.
I know how professional software structure looks and I hate it.

With that being said, enjoy :)

## Getting started

If you just want to use the program, run the executable (which will be added some time in the future).
Your antivirus software might complain, but you can run it without installing anything else.

If you want to run the scripts in Python, install the necessary packages
(I believe it's obvious that you need to have Python installed).
Just copy this into your CMD-Window:
```commandline
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install FreeSimpleGUI
```

open main.py to run the script as intended.
